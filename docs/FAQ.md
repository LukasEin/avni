General
-------

Is it free?
-----------

Yes! The master branch of our repository is synchronized for open-source access from various locations on the internet - pypi, conda-forge - and is hosted in a public account. This repository can be used for free under the GNU GPL v3 [LICENSE](../LICENSE).

Is all our code open-source?
----------------------------

Our public Github pure-Python repository is provided open-source with the GNU GPL v3 [LICENSE](../LICENSE). In order to encourage involvement by the relevant domain experts and introduce them to the merits of benchmarking code without the necessary overhead of immediately catering to requests in an open-source environment.

How can we get involved?
------------------------

Become a tester or contributor! Please try out our codes in various applications and let us know.  Fork our public repository, contribute code and raise [issues or requests](https://github.com/globalseismology/rem3d/issues). If you want to be a co-developer, please request access rights our [Website](http://rem3d.org/join-us/github).

I am a domain expert in geosciences. Why should I get involved?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Because you will have fun and work with other domain experts! We have the necessary infrastructure in place for benchmarking, developing and testing algorithms. Your work will build on legacy codes spanning multiple decades that have been optimized for modern infrastructure. You will work in a copyrighted, private branch or repository that will not be released publicly without your written approval. Given other scientific commitments, you will avoid the necessary overhead of immediately catering to requests inherent in an open-source environment.

Installation
------------

What are the system requirements?
--------------------------------

REM3D has been tested on the following platforms: Linux (Ubuntu, Redhat, CentOS), MacOS and Windows. It requires a python installation with versions 3.3 and above.

Privacy
-------

Why do you provide APIs?
------------------------

We want researchers to spend less time installing complex dependencies, debugging and more on the science. Some users may not have the necessary infrastructure to deal with big data and our scientific codes. Moreover, it is very difficult for us to spend time testing legacy and new codes across platforms. We provide Application programming interfaces (APIs) that interface with heavy, legacy codes hosted on our servers so that REM3D installation remains light to serve various applications.

Is there a cap on the number of calls to the API?
-------------------------------------------------

The number of calls are capped at 5000 per day per public user. This is limited by the current hardware and as the project evolves, we hope to increase the limit. If you find REM3D useful, please let the funding agencies know or leave a public [comment](https://github.com/globalseismology/rem3d/issues).
