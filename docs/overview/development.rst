AVNI Development
================

.. warning:: Reminder: all contributors are expected to follow our
          :doc:`code of conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT>`. All contributions
          are governed by the terms of our :doc:`license <../getting-started/cite>`.

AVNI is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e. including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating!

To *report* bugs, *request* new features, or *ask about* confusing
documentation, it's usually best to open a new issue on `AVNI Forum`_
first; you'll probably get help fastest that way, and it helps keep our GitHub
issue tracker focused on things that we *know* will require changes to our
software (as opposed to problems that can be fixed in the user's code). We may
ultimately ask you to open an issue on GitHub too, but starting on the forum
helps us keep things organized. For fastest results, be sure to include
information about your operating system and AVNI version, and (if
applicable) include a reproducible code sample that is as short as possible.


The project accepts contributions in the form of
bug reports, fixes and feature additions.
For *general troubleshooting*
or *usage questions*, please consider posting your questions on our |discuss|.
The best way to start contributing is by raising
|issues| on our GitHub page to discuss ideas for changes or enhancements,
or to tell us about behavior that you think might be a bug.

The goal of this page is to provide instructions and best practices to guide developers and
contributing scientists. .

.. note:: Please route your *general* questions to the `AVNI Forum`_.  The helps our GitHub
         issue tracker focused on things that we *know* will require changes to our
         software (as opposed to problems that can be fixed in the user's code).
