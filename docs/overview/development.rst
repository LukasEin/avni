AVNI Development
================

.. warning:: Reminder: all contributors are expected to follow our
          `code of conduct`_.

AVNI is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e. including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating!

This project is maintained by a community of
scientists and research labs. The project accepts contributions in the form of
bug reports, fixes, feature additions, and documentation improvements
(including typo corrections). The best way to start contributing is by raising
|issues| on our GitHub page to discuss ideas for changes or enhancements,
or to tell us about behavior that you think might be a bug. For *general troubleshooting*
or *usage questions*, please consider posting your questions on our |discuss|.

The goal of this page is to provide instructions and best practices to guide developers and
contributing scientists. It is intended as a developer reference, not as
a replacement for the user manual.
