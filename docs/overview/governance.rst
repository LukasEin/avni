==================
Project Governance
==================

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process
used by the AVNI project in various
situations, and to clarify how decisions are made and how the various
elements of our community interact.  This document elucidates the relationship between
open source collaborative development and work that may be funded by entities
that require private development.


The Project
===========

The AVNI software ecosystem (The Project) is designed to be an open source software project. The
goal of The Project is to develop open source software for analysis of
geoscience data in Python. The Project is released under the GNU GPL v3 (or similar) `license
<LICENSE_>`_, developed openly and is hosted publicly under the
``globalseismology`` `GitHub organization <AVNI Github_>`_.

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code,
documentation, designs, or other work to the Project. Anyone can be a
Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or
none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting, reviewing,
and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open
and public Project discussions on GitHub, Discourse, and other
channels. The foundation of Project participation is openness and
transparency.

The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the
Project. Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the
larger Project Community and we strive to keep the barrier between
Contributors and Users as low as possible.

The Project is not a legal entity, nor does it currently have any formal
relationships with legal entities.

Community Effort
================

AVNI software ecosystem (The Project) is part of the wider community effort to
create a three-dimensional reference Earth model `REM3D
<REM3D_>`_. A description
of the REM3D project is provided in :footcite:`moulik_rem_surface_waves`, and a complete
list of relevant papers is provided below:

.. footbibliography::

.. dropdown:: BibTeX for REM3D
    :color: info
    :icon: typography

    .. include:: ../references.bib
        :code: bibtex
        :start-after: % REM3D reference
        :end-before: % everything else

In order to maximize the likelihood of success and utility to the broader deep Earth community,
the REM3D project receives input from two advisory working groups,
one focused on the reference dataset, and the other on the reference model.

Governance model
================

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The
Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

-  openness and transparency
-  active contribution
-  institutional neutrality


Traditionally, Project leadership was provided by a subset of Contributors,
informally called Core Developers, whose active and consistent contributions
were rewarded by granting them “commit rights” to the Project GitHub
repositories. In general, all Project decisions are made through consensus among
the Core Developers with input from the Community.
