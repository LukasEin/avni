Versioning conventions
======================

Version tagging is based on a `major.minor.patch` numbering scheme following Semantic Versioning Specification ([SemVer](https://semver.org)).

- The *major* number is incremented after extensive rewrites or substantial overhauls that may significantly affect workflow integration or user experience.  Major updates undergo extensive testing, but subsequent patch updates may still be needed.

- The *minor* number is incremented whenever modifications to the source code are significant enough to require updates to parameter files or other input files.

- The *patch* number is used to denote bug fixes or other minor revisions. Updates to parameter files or other input files are not required.

[Tagged releases](https://github.com/globalseismology/avni/tags) are fairly infrequent because the associated testing is very time consuming.
